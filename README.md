here is the exaplnation to the go snippit 
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

The Go code provided implements a concurrent execution pattern using Goroutines and channels. It starts by initializing a buffered channel named cnp capable of holding up to 10 functions. This channel serves as a communication medium between Goroutines. The subsequent loop spawns four Goroutines, each executing an anonymous function. These Goroutines remain active, awaiting functions to be sent through the cnp channel. Notably, the loop doesn't execute sequentially; instead, Goroutines are launched concurrently due to the go keyword, allowing for simultaneous execution. Within each Goroutine, a range loop listens for functions sent to the cnp channel. However, at this stage, no functions have been sent, so the Goroutines remain idle. The main Goroutine then attempts to send a function to cnp, intending to print "HERE1". Unfortunately, due to the timing of execution, this send operation occurs after the Goroutines have started listening, leading to the loss of the "HERE1" message. Finally, the main Goroutine proceeds to print "Hello". This coding structure is commonly employed in scenarios requiring parallel processing, such as concurrent task execution or implementing efficient worker pools.
